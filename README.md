## Test Driven Development (TDD)

The main goal of this project is to practice TDD with Jest by developing the game logic and functionality of the "Battleship" board game. The project emphasizes on isolating the game logic from the actual DOM manipulation.

### Features

- Five ships to place on the gameboard
- Preview ships by hovering on the board and place them by clicking
- Ships cannot be placed adjacent to other ships
- Ships can be placed vertically or horizontally
- Play against the computer
